# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews with Recurrent Neural Networks
## Motivation
- One of the most important elements for a business is to constanly be aware of the customer reaction and interaction with the company's product. It is vital for these organizations to know exactly (or asses with high probability) what consumers or clients think of recently released and established products or services. Companies are also interested in evaluating customer response to recent initiatives as well as customer service offerings.
- Sentiment analysis is one way to accomplish this necessary task. Sentiment analysis is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds models with the aim to identify and classify attributes of the expression contained in the text. We are interested in identifying polarity in the Amazon review text.
- Sentiment Analysis can help to automatically transform the unstructured information into structured data of public opinions about products, services, brands, politics or any other topic that people can express opinions about. This data can be very useful for:
    - commercial applications such as marketing analysis
    - public relations
    - product reviews and feedback
    - customer service.

## Goal
- In this project a Neural Network (Deep Learning model) based on Recurrent Neural Networks aims to classify human emotion (sentiment) in an Amazon review. In other words, we are interested in the sentiment that an Amazon review conveys which could be either possitive or negative.


## Tools
  - Python 3.6.8
  - Keras 2.2.4
  - TensorFlow 1.12.0


## Data
- Dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014. These reviews, made available by \[[Julian McAuley, UCSD], are raw qualitative (text) and quantitative (rating) evaluations of products by users

## Preprocessing
- Before we can use the reviews as inputs for the recurrent neural network it is required to do some preprocessing on the data. Our main purpose here is to shrink the observation space. Following preprocessing techniques are applied:
    - Remove review repeats
    - Uniform Spelling of Words by lowercasing all words in reviews
    - Removing Special Characters ( . , ! ? ‘ etc) 

## Word Embeddings
- The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the ordered frequency of each word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers.
- Word Embeddings are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging NLP problems.
- Each word is mapped to one specific vector and the vector values are learned by the neural network.
- Toy example since usually we expect higher dimensions:
"life" = [8.3 5.7 7.8 4.6 2.5]

## How to Reduce Overfitting with Regularization in a Neural Network?
- Hyperparameter tuning is applied in Keras
- Dropout regularization is applied to visible or hidden neurons of network model
- Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are “dropped-out” randomly. By doing this their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.
